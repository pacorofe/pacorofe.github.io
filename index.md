I am a PhD Candidate in the [Collective Behaviour Lab](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/groups/grupo-collective-behavior) at the [Champalimaud Research](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/) at the [Champalimaud Center for the Uknown](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/) in Lisbon, Portugal. During my PhD I've developed the multi-animal tracking system [idtracker.ai](https://idtrackerai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I also performed behaviour experiments in collectives of zebrafish (Danio Rerio), and applied different data anaylsis techniques (from basic machine learning to state of the art attention networks) to understand how animals transfer information in groups.
