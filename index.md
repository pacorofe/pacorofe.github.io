I am a PhD Candidate in the [Collective Behaviour Lab](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/groups/grupo-collective-behavior) at the [Champalimaud Research](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/researchfc/) at the [Champalimaud Center for the Uknown](https://www.fchampalimaud.org/) in Lisbon, Portugal. During my PhD I've developed the multi-animal tracking system [idtracker.ai](https://idtrackerai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I also performed behaviour experiments in collectives of zebrafish (*Danio rerio*), and applied different data anaylsis techniques (from basic machine learning to state of the art attention networks) to understand how animals transfer information in groups.
